# PacMan
Pacman Factory Exercise
Uploaded October 20, 2021

This project loads two buttons on the page. One button to generate
pacmen and the other to begin their movement.

In the future I plan to add a stop button and an option to remove pacmen.

To run this program download all correlating files from my GitHub Repository into a single folder, then drag
and drop the HTML file into your browser. Enjoy!
